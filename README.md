Picking the perfect set of map icons for your web map can be hard, especially when you do not know where to find them. As a GIS web Developer, most of my projects –  if not all – involve showing some points of interest or other locational information with markers. The Internet is a massive resource, but where do you get them?

Here I have compiled a list of sites where you can readily find awesome icons to use in your web-map for free.

#[Map Icons](http://map-icons.com/)
An icon font for use with Google Maps API and Google Places API using SVG markers and icon labels.  
Map Icons makes Google Maps Markers dynamic with control over shape, color, size, and icon easily changed using options in the marker object as well as simple SVG Notation and CSS.

#[Templatic Map Icons](http://templatic.com/news/100-free-templatic-map-icons/)
Templatic released their map icons for use (email required) outside their products. This means you can download them and add them to your own maps. Pick and choose from icons like fashion, residential, pizza, and more.  
The icons themselves come in a nice color scheme with flat hues and thin border outlines. You may want to change them to suit you map colors or standardize them to a particular shade.

#[Maki](https://www.mapbox.com/maki/)
This creates Mapbox Pixel-perfect icons for web cartography. Maki includes icons for common points of interest like parks, museums, and places of worship. Each icon is available as an SVG in two sizes: 11px by 11px and 15px by 15px.
If Maki is missing an icon that you need for a project,you can easily suggest it from their [github page](https://github.com/mapbox/maki/issues).

#[Map Icons Collection](https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/)
The Map Icons Collection is a set of more than 1000 free and customizable icons to use as place-marks for your POI (Point of Interests) locations on your maps.  
There are a ton of categories to choose from with each holding many icons. There’s also a cool color selector on the site so you can customize the icons before you download.

#[Google Maps Markers (GitHub)](https://github.com/Concept211/Google-Maps-Markers)
Google's new marker icons look great, but they never bothered to provide us with matching PNG versions of them when we need custom colors and labels.  
[Concept211](https://github.com/Concept211) went ahead and created a whole set using ImageMagick. 

You download and install ImageMagick, and an ImageMagick.vbs file, and use them to create your own set.  You can link to the pre-generated images created instead of creating your own.

#[OSM icons](http://osm-icons.org/wiki/Icons)
This is a set of free SVG icons that are used for OSM maps. All the  icons are vector files in .svg format and therefore can be used for any size and with any background colour and any colour of the motive.
