Picking the perfect set of map icons for your web map can be hard, especially when you do not know where to find them. As a GIS web Developer, most of my projects –  if not all – involve showing some points of interest or other locational information with markers. The Internet is a massive resource, but where do you get them?

Here I have compiled a list of sites where you can readily find awesome icons to use in your web-map for free.
